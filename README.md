Tools Used in the Project: File Handling Utility using Java

The File Handling Utility project was developed using several important software tools and technologies that support Java application development, coding, execution, and testing. Each tool plays a specific role in successfully implementing file operations such as creating, reading, writing, copying, and deleting files.

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Visual Studio Code is the primary development environment used in this project. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, editing, and managing Java source code. VS Code supports syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and extensions, which help improve coding efficiency and reduce errors. It also allows easy project organization and quick execution of Java programs.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Java Development Kit is an essential tool required to develop and run Java applications. It includes the Java compiler (javac), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and standard libraries. In this project, the JDK enables compilation and execution of Java programs and provides built-in libraries for file handling operations.

3. Java Programming Language
Java is the core programming language used in this project. It is platform-independent, secure, and widely used for system and application development. Java provides powerful file handling support through packages like java.io and java.nio.file, which are extensively used in this project.

4. java.io Package
The java.io package is used for basic input and output operations. Classes such as File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter help in reading and writing text data to files. These classes enable efficient handling of file streams.

5. java.nio.file Package
The java.nio.file package provides advanced file handling features. Classes like Path, Paths, and Files are used for creating files, copying files, checking file existence, and deleting files. This package improves performance and simplifies file operations.

6. Command Line / Terminal
The terminal or command prompt is used to compile and run Java programs. Commands such as javac and java help in building and executing the application, ensuring correct program output.

7. Operating System (Windows)
The operating system manages file storage and permissions. It allows interaction with the file system where files are created, modified, or deleted during program execution.

8. Debugging and Exception Handling Tools
VS Code’s debugging features and Java’s exception handling mechanisms (try, catch, finally) help identify and fix runtime errors. They ensure safe execution of file operations and prevent data loss.

Together, these tools enable the successful development and execution of the File Handling Utility project, providing practical experience with Java file management concepts.
